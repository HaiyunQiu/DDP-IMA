<h2>Puzzle</h2>
<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
<p>For the common jigsaw puzzle, see Jigsaw puzzle. For other uses, see Puzzle (disambiguation).
A puzzle is a game, problem, or toy that tests a person's ingenuity or knowledge. In a puzzle, the solver is expected to put pieces together in a logical way, in order to arrive at the correct or fun solution of the puzzle. There are different genres of puzzles, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, relational puzzles, and logic puzzles.

Puzzles are often created to be a form of entertainment but they can also arise from serious mathematical or logical problems. In such cases, their solution may be a significant contribution to mathematical research.</p>
